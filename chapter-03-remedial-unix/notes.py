"""
'cat' - Concatenate; to print a file's contents to standard out (kind of like print() in python)
    it also allows one to print multiple files' contents to the standard output stream
'>' - this operator redirects standard output to a file. this will overwrite existing contents! if file doesn't already exist, it will be created
'>>' - this operator appends to the file. if file doesn't already exist, it will be created

ran the following in the terminal 'cat tb1-protein.fasta tga1-protein.fasta > zea-proteins.fasta' and created the zea-proteins.fasta file
